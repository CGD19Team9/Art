Git repo for art stuff

Try to keep your stuff in your own folder.

Quick crash course or something in git;
If you haven't already, make your own branch (keeps your changes separate to everyone else's and keeps merging things easy)

Once you've finished working on stuff, make sure it's in the git repo folder (repository, view in explorer or press Ctrl+Shift+F). 
Go to the github desktop thing.
You should see a list of changed files in your folder, fill in the summary (it can be brief, just say what you added), then commit.
When you're done for the day or whenever you feel like really, press the push button under the repository menu. Or press Ctrl+P. 
===Until you do this, none of your stuff will be uploaded===
